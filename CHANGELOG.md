# Changelog

## v1.3.1 — Upstream Sync (2026-03-12)

Synced with [CortexReach/memory-lancedb-pro](https://github.com/CortexReach/memory-lancedb-pro) master (v1.1.0-beta.6+).

### Changed

- **Retriever**: Added `source` field to `RetrievalContext` — access reinforcement now only fires on manual retrieval, preventing auto-recall from strengthening noise memories (synced from upstream beta.2 design).
- **Noise filter**: Added Chinese meta-question patterns (`你记得`, `记不记得`, `还记得…吗`, `上次…说`, `之前…提到`) and diagnostic artifact filter (synced from upstream beta.3).
- **README**: Updated upstream credit link from `win4r/memory-lancedb-pro` to `CortexReach/memory-lancedb-pro`, added CortexReach team acknowledgement.

## v1.2.0 — First Distributable Release (2026-03-08)

The goal of this release: a new user can go from `git clone` to first search result in 15 minutes.

### New

- **`lm doctor`** — one-command pre-flight check for Bun, config, API key, data directory, transcript paths, and index health. Supports `--ci` mode for GitHub Actions.
- **`lm demo`** — run sample queries to see RecallNest in action before writing your own.
- **`config.json.example`** — ships with absolute `~/.recallnest/data/lancedb` path. New users copy this instead of editing the tracked config.
- **GitHub Actions CI** — runs `doctor --ci` and TypeScript check on every push.
- **Ingest pre-validation** — embedding API is tested before processing any files. Invalid Jina key now fails fast with a clear message instead of crashing mid-ingest.

### Changed

- **README rewritten** — added Prerequisites table (Bun + Jina key), 5-step quickstart with expected output, Troubleshooting section.
- **Gemini support marked "coming soon"** — README, config example, and doctor all honestly reflect that Gemini CLI sessions are encrypted protobuf and not yet parseable. The `lm ingest` command prints a clear skip message instead of silently failing.
- **Config path robustness** — default `dbPath` changed from relative `./data/lancedb` to absolute `~/.recallnest/data/lancedb` in config example. Auto-detect failure messages now include the user's actual home path.
- **`config.json` untracked** — added to `.gitignore` so user config is not overwritten by `git pull`.

### Fixed

- Auto-detect hint in `doctor` now shows a real example path based on the current user's home directory.
- `findConfigPath()` error message now suggests `cp config.json.example config.json` when the example file exists.
